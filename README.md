# SEO Keyword Generator Tool

This repository contains a WordPress plugin that integrates with Gemini AI to generate SEO keywords based on a user's business description. The tool includes a frontend interface built with HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, and a backend PHP component that handles API calls via a custom WordPress REST endpoint.

The frontend allows users to input a description, triggers an AI generation process, and displays results in a clean, dark-themed table with options to copy data to the clipboard.

## Features
- **User Input**: Textarea for entering business/topic descriptions.
- **AI Integration**: Uses a system prompt to generate 10-15 long-tail SEO keywords with simulated data (Search Volume, Competition, CPC).
- **Output Display**: Results shown in a responsive table.
- **Loading State**: Spinner during API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors gracefully.
- **Copy Functionality**: Copies table data to clipboard in tab-separated format.
- **Dark Mode Theme**: Modern, clean UI with customizable CSS variables.

## Prerequisites
- WordPress installation (as this is a plugin using WP REST API).
- Access to Gemini AI API (configured in the PHP backend). Sign up at https://ai.google.dev/ to get an API key.
- Basic knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, HTML/CSS for customization.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
2. **Set Up WordPress Plugin**:
- Copy the entire folder into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory (e.g., `wp-content/plugins/seo-keyword-generator/`).
- Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin dashboard (Plugins > Installed Plugins > Activate "SEO Keyword Generator").

3. **Configure API Key**:
- Open `seo-keyword-generator.php` in a text editor.
- Find the line: `define('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE');`
- Replace `'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual Gemini AI API key.
- Save the file. This key is used to authenticate requests to the Gemini API. Without it, the tool will fail with authentication errors.
- **Security Note**: Never commit your API key to GitHub. Use environment variables or a config file outside the repo for production. If sharing the repo, keep the placeholder.

4. **Add Frontend to a Page**:
- Create a new WordPress page (Pages > Add New).
- Switch to the "Code Editor" (or use a Custom HTML block in Gutenberg).
- Copy the entire content from `frontend.html` in this repo and paste it into the page content.
- Publish the page. The tool will now be accessible at that page's URL (e.g., yoursite.com/seo-keyword-tool).

## Usage
1. Navigate to the WordPress page where the frontend is embedded.
2. Enter a business description or topic in the textarea (e.g., "A coffee shop in Seattle targeting eco-conscious millennials").
3. Click "Generate Keywords".
4. Wait for the AI to process (loader appears).
5. View the results in the table below.
6. Click "Copy to Clipboard" to export the data.

## Why Use API Integration?
- The plugin uses the Gemini AI API to generate structured JSON responses for keywords. This allows for dynamic, AI-powered content without hardcoding data.
- API calls are handled securely via WordPress's `wp_remote_post` to avoid CORS issues and ensure compatibility.
- The REST endpoint (`/wp-json/webloop/v1/generate-ai-content`) is public by default but can be restricted with permissions for production.

## Customization Guide: Adapting for Another Purpose
This tool is modular and can be repurposed (e.g., for generating blog ideas, product names). Follow these steps:

### Changing the API Key
- As mentioned in Installation step 3.
- If you want to use a different AI provider (e.g., OpenAI), modify the `$api_url` and payload in `generate_ai_content_callback()` function in `seo-keyword-generator.php`. Update the API endpoint and authentication method accordingly.

### Frontend Changes (frontend.html)
- Update title: Change `<h1>SEO Keyword Generator</h1>` to new title.
- Modify system prompt in JS: Edit `const system_prompt = ...` for new AI behavior.
- Change table columns in `displayTableResults()` if output structure changes.
- Update CSS variables for theme tweaks.

### Backend Changes (seo-keyword-generator.php)
- Modify endpoint: Change `register_rest_route` path if needed.
- Adjust payload: Customize `$payload` for different AI models.
- Add permissions: Replace `__return_true` with a callback for user authentication.

### Testing
- Test API: Use tools like Postman to POST to `/wp-json/webloop/v1/generate-ai-content` with JSON body.
- Debug: Check WP error logs or browser console.
